# Dijkstra Algorithm
This project was made as an exercises in my 2nd semester of college. The project itself runs the algorithm of Dijkstra on a graph based on the village of Pilisj√°szfalu.

When you run it, it starts a ConsoleApplication, and asks a question whether you wanna start the algorithm or you would like to add new nodes or edges to the project, like so:

With writing "yes" as an answer you can start running the Dijkstra algorithm after giving two ids, which represent the start and end nodes for Dijkstra.

With writing "add" you can start modifying the original Graph.
